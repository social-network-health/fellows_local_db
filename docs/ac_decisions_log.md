# Architectural Decisions Log

A log of decisions where an architectural constraint shaped an
implementation choice in a way that's worth remembering. Most
implementation choices live fine inside the code itself or a PR
description; this file is for the smaller set where:

- An architectural commitment (a PNA-spec AC, a `CLAUDE.md` rule, or
  a section of `docs/Architecture.md`) was the deciding factor,
- The constraint isn't visible at the point where the choice shows
  up in code, so a future contributor seeing only the artifact would
  reasonably make a different call,
- And the alternative would have been the natural default without
  the constraint.

Entries are append-only — superseded decisions stay, with a forward
link to the newer entry. Newest first.

## 2026-06-07 — Encryption-at-rest is rejected for the live private store; encryption belongs in-transit (the portable export)

**Why this is worth recording.** A "Lock my user data" branch (PR #155)
built opt-in app-layer encryption-at-rest (EAR) for `relationships.db`
(PBKDF2/AES-GCM, non-extractable worker-memory key) and reached phases 1–3
before stalling. A future contributor seeing a security-review line item
"encrypt user data at rest" — or the harvested crypto in the closed PR —
would reasonably resume it. We are deciding **not to**: app-EAR for the
*live* store is rejected. Full analysis in
[`architectural_findings.md`](architectural_findings.md) (2026-06-07);
discussion in [#256](https://github.com/social-network-health/fellows_local_db/issues/256).

**The constraint that shaped the decision.** App-EAR for the live store is
both *dominated* and *contradictory*:

- **Dominated by device FDE.** Its entire defended-threat-set (stolen/
  discarded device, offline drive image) is a strict subset of what
  FileVault/BitLocker/LUKS already cover, in hardware, for the whole
  device — while it *adds* a forgotten-passphrase → permanent-data-loss
  risk.
- **Contradicts `CST-PWA-SANDBOX-SEALED`.** Folder mode exists so
  `relationships.db` is *a real file the user's other tools read* (MCP
  `private_data_ops`, sqlite3 CLI, backups). A `.locked` ciphertext is
  opaque to them, so "locked" and "tool-readable folder mode" are mutually
  exclusive. EAR re-seals exactly the boundary the PNA model opens.

**What we do instead.** Recommend device FDE (the stronger, OS-managed
at-rest layer). Encryption's right home in a PNA is **in-transit**: an
encrypted, versioned *portable export* crossing an untrusted commodity
channel (email, etc.), where the live store stays plaintext/tool-readable
and the passphrase cost lands on an occasional, deliberate "move my data"
action. That is the sanctioned direction
([#257](https://github.com/social-network-health/fellows_local_db/issues/257)); the
harvested crypto envelope from PR #155 (`eb66109`) is the reusable part.

## 2026-05-30 — Cloud-LLM integration is allowed but treated as a named, reversible "exception" that exits PNA mode, not forbidden and not silent

**Why this is worth recording.** The PNA definition is "local-only,
never as SaaS," and AC-MCP-A wants cloud-AI access to private data gated.
A future contributor seeing the Claude Desktop integration ship will
reasonably ask: *"doesn't wiring a cloud LLM to the directory just
violate the whole premise?"* It does — deliberately. Our ~500-fellow
user base wants Claude Desktop on the hosted model, and local AI isn't
realistic for them (see [`architectural_findings.md`](architectural_findings.md)).
Rather than forbid the feature or allow it silently, we model the
violation as a first-class **exception** (`EX-CLOUD-LLM`): accepting the
consent gate **raises** it and takes the app out of *PNA mode*; the
handler is the persistent "Going rogue — not a PNA" banner, the in-app
`#/exception/<id>` explainer, and a **reversible** "Return to PNA mode"
control.

**The constraint that shaped the code.** Conformance is reframed from
"never deviates" to "catches and handles every deviation honestly." So
the code does *not* hide the state: it stamps `data-pna-mode` /
`data-pna-exceptions` on `<body>` (a greppable marker a conformance check
can catch), surfaces the banner unmissably, and makes the exit path real.
Reversibility is **mode-only** — returning to PNA mode stops future
sharing but does not recall data already sent; the UI says so rather than
implying an undo. Without the exception framing, the natural default
would have been a buried README caveat (the prior state — see
`mcp_servers/README.md`) and an app that quietly stopped being a PNA.

**Upstream.** This is staged as a Personal Network Toolkit contribution
(a new `spec/exceptions.md`, a `lint-spec-ids.py` extension for `EX-*` /
`Relaxes:` / `Reversible:`, and the validation-not-certification framing)
in [`../plans/pna_toolkit_exceptions_contribution.md`](../plans/pna_toolkit_exceptions_contribution.md);
fellows_local_db is the demonstrating reference design. Not yet filed.

## 2026-05-22 — MCP easy install is Chromium-desktop-first; Safari / Firefox get a documented secondary path; cross-browser-on-one-device data silos are accepted, not engineered around

**Why this is worth recording.** A future contributor reading
`plans/easy_mcp_install.md` and the user-folder-storage code will
reasonably ask: *"why don't we support easy MCP install for Safari
users?"* and *"why doesn't installing the PWA in a second browser
pick up the user's existing data?"* The answer to both is the same
shape: **browser storage is per-origin per-browser, and only
Chromium has the `showDirectoryPicker` API that lets a PWA hold
ongoing read/write access to a folder.** This constraint is
fundamental to the browser platform, not something our code
chose. Without this entry, a contributor might either (a) try to
engineer around it (cross-browser sync, server-side storage,
periodic-re-export prompts on Safari) — each of which violates a
different architectural commitment — or (b) silently let the user
experience drift toward "works in Chrome, mysteriously broken in
Safari" without documenting why.

**Context.** The MCP install plan
([`plans/easy_mcp_install.md`](../plans/easy_mcp_install.md))
needs a stable filesystem path that the `.mcpb`'s `user_config`
can default to, so the user picks their `relationships.db` once
and it stays current going forward. The post-Phase-2 design
anchors this on the user-folder storage feature: the user picks
a data folder, the PWA writes `<folder>/Fellows/relationships.db`
on every commit, and the `.mcpb` install dialog file-picker
points at that stable file.

This works because the PWA can write to a user-picked folder
continuously via `showDirectoryPicker` + the persistent handle
stored in IDB. The browsers that ship the API as of 2026:
Chrome 86+, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera. The browsers that don't:
**Safari** (single-file `showOpenFilePicker` / `showSaveFilePicker`
only, since 15.2 — no directory access), **Firefox** (no File
System Access API at all), and Safari/Chrome on iOS (mobile
browsers).

For Safari and Firefox users, the only way to get
`relationships.db` onto the filesystem is the existing
*Download my user data* button, which emits a one-shot snapshot
into `~/Downloads/`. The `.mcpb` install dialog can point at that
snapshot — but the snapshot goes stale the moment the user makes
any further mutation in the PWA, and there is no API for the PWA
to silently re-export.

A separate constraint surfaced during the conversation that
produced this entry: **browser storage is per-origin per-browser
on the same device.** A fellow who installs the PWA in Safari,
uses it for a month, then opens the same URL in Chrome will see a
fresh empty state — Chrome's OPFS namespace for the origin is
empty, and the `fellows_authenticated_once` localStorage marker
is also per-browser. There is no API to detect "this user has
data for this origin in another browser on this device"; storage
isolation is the whole point of per-browser sandboxes. Manual
export-from-Safari + import-into-Chrome via the existing
*Restore from a file* button is the only migration path.

**Alternatives considered.**

1. **Auto-export on Safari/Firefox.** Some kind of
   `beforeunload` or periodic export that lands a fresh
   `relationships.db` in `~/Downloads`. **Rejected**: the
   File System Access API the PWA would need (`showSaveFilePicker`)
   requires explicit user-gesture activation for each write. There
   is no headless "save my data automatically" mechanism for
   non-OPFS files on Safari/Firefox. Trying to fake it (prompt on
   every commit) is worse UX than the current stale-after-export
   reality.

2. **Server-side mirror of relationships.db.** Persist the user's
   private DB on prod so the MCP can fetch from there. **Rejected**:
   violates AC-2 *(no SaaS surface — `deploy/server.py` has no
   per-user RW endpoints)* and the entire never-SaaS stance the app
   is built on. Worth re-evaluating only if AC-2 itself is
   revisited.

3. **Cross-browser data sync via shared filesystem location.**
   Have the PWA write to a known absolute path that any browser
   could read. **Rejected**: Safari/Firefox have no API to write
   to a user-chosen path at all (let alone a hardcoded one). Even
   on Chromium, two browsers picking the same folder produces
   dueling writes — Web Locks API scope is per-origin-per-browser
   and can't coordinate cross-browser. Plan already calls this
   out in § Non-goals.

4. **Document the constraints + recommend Chromium for fellows
   who want MCP.** **Chosen.** The MCP install walkthrough makes
   the Chromium requirement explicit. Safari/Firefox users see a
   documented secondary path (manual re-export). The plan accepts
   cross-browser data silos as a user-visible reality and
   provides a "migrate from another browser" affordance in
   Settings (export-from-A → import-to-B) for users who want to
   consolidate.

**Decision.**

- **Easy MCP install (set-it-up-once UX)** is supported on
  Chromium desktop browsers (Chrome / Edge / Brave / Arc) on
  macOS, Windows, Linux. This is the Pareto slice; the
  `plans/easy_mcp_install.md` § 2 v1 scope.

- **Safari / Firefox desktop**: documented secondary path. The
  `.mcpb` install dialog file-picker accepts a one-shot
  `Download my user data` snapshot; the MCP's view is whatever
  was exported last. Users who want a live MCP view are
  recommended to switch to a Chromium browser for the fellows
  app.

- **Cross-browser-on-one-device data silos**: accepted as a
  user-visible reality, not engineered around. Documented in the
  users-manual + addressed via a *"migrate from another
  browser"* affordance (link to the export/import recipe) in
  Settings → Restore from backup. No attempt to detect the
  cross-browser case in the PWA (no API for it).

- **Forward-looking**: when WebKit ships `showDirectoryPicker`
  (currently "in development" on
  [webkit.org/status](https://webkit.org/status)), Safari users
  automatically join the green path with zero code change. Same
  for Firefox if/when they ship the API. No special migration —
  they pick a folder and they're in folder mode.

**Consequences.**

- Pro: the MCP install UX is honest, scoped, and shippable. No
  attempt to hide the constraint behind awkward workarounds that
  would feel broken in production.
- Pro: the implementation roadmap stays small. Stage 1 of the
  MCP install plan (Chromium-desktop only) is the v1 ship; the
  Safari/Firefox secondary path is documentation + reuse of
  existing UI, not new code.
- Pro: free upgrade for Safari/Firefox users when WebKit / Gecko
  ship the API. Their migration is automatic.
- Con: the test group includes Safari-primary users who will
  have a degraded MCP experience until they either switch
  browsers for the fellows app or wait for WebKit to ship FSA.
  The honest framing is *"MCP is a Chromium-desktop bonus
  feature"* — not a universal one — and the install walkthrough
  has to be upfront about that.
- Con: users who install the PWA in multiple browsers on the
  same Mac will discover their data is per-browser. The
  *"migrate from another browser"* affordance mitigates but
  doesn't fully resolve the surprise. Some friction is
  unavoidable here.

## 2026-05-22 — User-folder storage uses pure-folder semantics for folder-mode users, not a hybrid OPFS+folder mirror

**Why this is worth recording.** The original `plans/user_folder_storage.md` (and the Phase 1 code shipped in #181) was built on a **hybrid** model: OPFS is the working store, the user's folder is a debounced mirror, and the worker synchronizes them after every committed mutation. A future contributor reading that code — particularly the auto-sync timers, the `markRelationshipsDirty` hook the plan was about to add in Phase 2, and the boot-time "read folder into OPFS" path — would reasonably conclude this is the canonical design and continue extending it. **It is not.** Phase 2 was the moment to pivot to pure-folder, because the hybrid's sync complexity buys us nothing at our DB scale and introduces a silent-data-loss failure mode.

**Context.** During the Phase 2 (auto-sync) scoping conversation on 2026-05-22, the question came up: *"is the hybrid model genuinely more reliable and less complex than a pure folder model, given the trajectory of the project?"* Walking through the failure modes carefully, we found one that hadn't surfaced in the original plan review:

1. User makes a mutation. OPFS commit succeeds. Debounced sync to folder scheduled.
2. Within the debounce window (500 ms), folder permission briefly lapses (system sleep, app eviction, parent folder temporarily unmounted by a sync service, etc.). Sync fires, fails. `folderRecord.lastError` is set; OPFS now has new data that the folder does not.
3. User closes the tab — or the browser crashes — before noticing the badge state.
4. User re-opens. The plan's documented boot sequence reads `relationships.db` from the folder (the "Saved" semantics treat the folder as canonical), copies it into OPFS, **overwriting the unsaved OPFS data**.
5. The user's recent mutations are silently gone, with no error indication.

The bug is structural to the hybrid model — two storage substrates plus async sync means there are scenarios where the "less authoritative" copy quietly wins. Patching the boot sequence to detect divergence is *more* code paths, not fewer. And we found this bug in a half-hour conversation; production was likely to surface others.

The hybrid model was chosen in the original plan because the canonical fast SQLite-wasm VFS (`OpfsSAHPoolVfs`) requires OPFS-resident `FileSystemSyncAccessHandle`s — folder files only expose async handles. Two arguments dismissed the pure-folder alternatives: (1) async-VFS is slow (Asyncify shim makes every read yield), (2) in-memory + rewrite-whole-file is "correctness risk on crash, thrashes the OS file cache." Both arguments are correct for medium/large databases. They do not apply at our scale (`relationships.db` is currently 98 KB and unlikely to exceed a few MB lifetime; mutations are user-paced, not high-frequency; storage I/O is not on any hot path). The browser's `FileSystemWritableFileStream.close()` is atomic per spec, so whole-file rewrite is crash-safe.

**Alternatives considered.**

1. **Hybrid OPFS + debounced folder sync** (the original plan). Performance preserved via sync-access handles. Cost: every divergence scenario must be reasoned about; silent-data-loss path exists; sync timers + dirty marker + in-flight guard + last-error tracking + boot-time divergence handling is real ongoing complexity. **Rejected.**

2. **Pure folder via async-VFS** (Asyncify, async file handles). Single source of truth. Cost: Asyncify performance hit (2-5x slower in synthetic benchmarks), need to write/maintain a custom VFS, File System Access API's `FileSystemWritableFileStream` doesn't expose random-access writes (which standard SQLite expects), so it would effectively rewrite the whole file on close anyway. **Rejected — same I/O behavior as option 3 with more code complexity.**

3. **Pure folder via mem-VFS + atomic full-file rewrite on commit.** Worker boots, reads folder file, `sqlite3_deserialize` into an in-memory DB. All reads/writes against the mem-DB synchronously. On committed mutation, `sqlite3_serialize` to bytes and atomic write to folder. Boot reads folder; close discards mem-DB. One source of truth (the folder), one storage path per session, no sync state, no divergence possible. Cost: per-mutation latency includes a whole-file folder write (sub-millisecond for our DB sizes). **Chosen.**

For users without folder picker support (Safari, Firefox, iOS, Android where the picker is unreliable), today's OPFS-resident SAH-pool VFS remains the path. Those users have one source of truth too (OPFS), with backup-to-Downloads as their durability story. The pivot does NOT introduce a hybrid for them — it preserves their existing single-source-of-truth model.

**Decision.** Phase 2 of `plans/user_folder_storage.md` pivots from "automatic debounced sync from OPFS to folder" to "swap the worker's VFS based on folder-handle presence: pure folder for folder-mode users, OPFS-only for the rest." Two storage modes, decided at boot per session. No sync between them.

**Consequences.**

- Pro: silent-data-loss failure mode eliminated. Every storage failure is either prevented or surfaces as a visible "your last change wasn't saved" UI state.
- Pro: the folder file is the truth at all times for folder-mode users. External readers (MCP servers, command-line `sqlite3`, manual `cp`, sync services) can rely on it without "is the folder current?" reasoning.
- Pro: dramatically simpler state machine in the worker. No sync timers, no dirty marker, no in-flight guard, no debounce, no last-sync-attempt tracking, no divergence detection.
- Pro: Phase 1's UI/permission/IDB surface (~540 lines) survives intact. Phase 1's `writeRelationshipsToFolder` becomes the per-commit write path.
- Pro: trajectory fit — MCP install plan (`plans/easy_mcp_install.md`) can anchor on the folder path as a current, authoritative file. Future multi-client support (Cursor, Continue, Ollama, etc.) inherits the same anchor.
- Con: per-mutation latency now includes a folder write. For our DB sizes this is sub-millisecond; if `relationships.db` ever grows past several MB it becomes user-visible, at which point caching/incremental-write strategies become an optimization play. Not a v1 concern.
- Con: in-memory mutation lost on tab crash is an HONEST failure mode (the user knows their change wasn't saved) rather than a SILENT one (the change appeared to save but didn't). This is the same posture as any non-syncing draft editor and is materially better than the hybrid's silent-divergence risk.
- Con: requires a one-time migration for Phase 1 users with both OPFS and folder state. Designed in the Phase 2 implementation spec.
- Con: Phase 2's engineering effort is ~1.5x the originally-scoped auto-sync work, because the worker's data path is genuinely rewritten. Phase 1 UI stays.

**Auto-backup ring**: lives in the user's folder for folder-mode users (`<parent>/Fellows/relationships.db.bak.<ISO>` siblings of `relationships.db`). Visible in Finder, comforting to users. OPFS-only-mode users keep today's OPFS-resident auto-backup ring. There is no auto-backup-in-OPFS for folder-mode users — one place per user, by design.

**OPFS-only users in the long term**: get a degraded experience (no MCP integration, no external visibility, browser-data-wipe-loses-everything). This is acceptable v2 floor; when those users want richer integration they switch browsers or get migrated to a future app variant. Out of scope for this decision.

## 2026-05-21 — `.mcpb` bundles do not ship native Node dependencies

**Why this is worth recording.** A future contributor adding the
`private-data-ops` port (or any new server in `mcpb/node/`) will be
tempted to reach for `better-sqlite3` (or `sharp`, or any other
N-API/native module). The existing Python `mcp_servers/` uses the
stdlib `sqlite3` module — there's no parallel "obvious" choice for
Node, and the better-sqlite3 ergonomics are excellent. The constraint
that forbids it isn't visible from the source side; it shows up only
when the bundle is installed in Claude Desktop and fails to load.

**Context.** Found during smoke test of #187. The first
`shared-data-ops.mcpb` build used `better-sqlite3`. It built cleanly,
passed all parity tests on the host, and the `.mcpb` validated. But
on install in Claude Desktop, the server process crashed 64ms after
the `initialize` message arrived — before the SDK could even respond.
Claude Desktop logged *"Server transport closed unexpectedly"*.

Direct reproduction (against the installed bundle):

```
$ node -e 'new (require("better-sqlite3"))("./fellows.db")'
Error: Could not locate the bindings file. Tried:
 → .../better-sqlite3/build/Release/better_sqlite3.node
 → ... [13 more paths]
```

The native `.node` binary wasn't in the bundle. Two compounding
reasons:

1. **`build/build_mcpb.py` ran `npm install --ignore-scripts`** so
   better-sqlite3's `install` hook (which downloads/compiles the
   native binding via `prebuild-install`) never ran.
2. **Even with that flag removed, the prebuilt would have been wrong:**
   the host machine runs Node 25 (modules ABI v141); Claude Desktop's
   Electron 41.6.1 bundles Node 24.15.0 (modules ABI v137).
   `prebuild-install` matches against the host's ABI, so a host-built
   bundle would have shipped a v141 binary that Claude Desktop's v137
   runtime couldn't load.

**Alternatives considered.**

1. **Remove `--ignore-scripts` and accept the ABI mismatch.**
   Doesn't actually work — the host-built binary would crash in
   Claude Desktop with a different error.

2. **Cross-build the binary against Claude Desktop's Node ABI.**
   Requires pinning a specific Node version in CI, running
   `prebuild-install --target=24.15.0`. Fragile to Electron's Node
   version changes (every Electron release updates the bundled Node
   version eventually). High maintenance cost.

3. **Use Node's built-in `node:sqlite` module.** Stable since
   Node 24.0. Zero native dependencies — it's compiled into Node
   itself, so it's *guaranteed* to work whatever Node version
   Claude Desktop bundles. **Chosen.**

**Decision.** `.mcpb` bundles do not ship native Node dependencies.
For SQLite specifically, `node:sqlite` is the path. For anything
else that would normally call for a native module (image processing,
crypto-with-fast-paths, etc.), the bundle either uses Node's
built-ins, falls back to a pure-JS implementation, or doesn't ship
that capability.

**Consequences.**

- Pro: zero ABI surface area between the bundle and Claude Desktop's
  Node runtime. Survives any Electron version change.
- Pro: smaller bundles — `shared_data_ops.mcpb` dropped from 6.7 MB
  to 3.8 MB after the better-sqlite3 removal.
- Pro: build pipeline can keep `--ignore-scripts` as a defense-in-depth
  measure against postinstall script supply-chain attacks.
- Con: gives up some performance-sensitive native libraries. Not
  relevant for our current surface; revisit if a future tool needs
  one (and address as a per-tool exception rather than a blanket
  policy change).

## 2026-05-21 — MCP servers ship as three separate `.mcpb` files, not one consolidated bundle

**Why this is worth recording.** A future contributor looking at
`mcpb/node/` and seeing three nearly-identical bundles with the same
build pipeline would reasonably consolidate them into one — that's
strictly better from a UX standpoint (one install dialog instead of
three) and the `.mcpb` manifest format gives no hint that anything
forbids it. The constraint that forbids it lives a layer up, in the
PNA spec's `mcp-exposure:shared+private+comms` axis pick and
AC-MCP-A's exception clause. Without this entry, the connection is
invisible at the point of change.

**Context.** Planning easy MCP installation for non-tech Mac users
via Claude Desktop's `.mcpb` (Desktop Extensions) format. See
[`plans/easy_mcp_install.md`](../plans/easy_mcp_install.md). The
PNA spec axis pick for this repo is
`mcp-exposure:shared+private+comms` — three servers explicitly.
AC-MCP-A requires explicit per-call consent for Private DB rows
flowing to cloud-hosted LLMs. `docs/Architecture.md` § *MCP-related
ACs activated by `mcp-exposure:shared+private+comms`* names the
three-server split as the satisfying mechanism — specifically:

> *"The Shared / Private split at the MCP surface lets a user wire
> a cloud client to Shared Data Ops alone without triggering this
> AC."*

The user's ability to opt into the safer subset depends on the
three servers being **independently enableable**. Claude Desktop's
Extensions UI toggles whole `.mcpb` extensions, not individual
servers inside an extension, and not individual tools inside a
server. So the three-bundle split is what carries the architectural
mechanism through to the install layer.

**Alternatives considered.**

1. **One consolidated `.mcpb` exposing all nine tools from one
   server.** Simplest UX — one install dialog, one toggle, one
   config row. **Rejected**: collapses the user's ability to enable
   Shared without enabling Private, erasing AC-MCP-A's exception
   clause at the install layer.

2. **One `.mcpb` with three internal MCP servers sharing a
   process.** The MCP spec allows multiple servers in one process,
   but Claude Desktop's Extensions UI toggles whole extensions, not
   internal servers. **Rejected**: same UX-vs-architecture loss as
   option 1.

3. **Three separate `.mcpb` files, each independently installable
   and toggleable.** Three install dialogs. **Chosen.**

**Decision.** Option 3 — three separate `.mcpb` files
(`fellows-shared-data-ops.mcpb`, `fellows-private-data-ops.mcpb`,
`fellows-comms.mcpb`).

**Consequences.**

- Pro: AC-MCP-A's exception clause survives intact at the install
  layer; users keep a structural way to choose Shared-only.
- Pro: Aligns with the `mcp-exposure:shared+private+comms` axis
  pick. No re-attestation required.
- Pro: Per-server enable/disable inside Claude Desktop's Extensions
  panel, which mirrors the privacy boundary the PWA already
  documents.
- Con: Three install dialogs instead of one. Real UX cost.
- Mitigation: The PWA Settings UI ("Set up Claude Desktop
  integration") sequences the three downloads behind a single
  button click and shows a **preamble dialog** that names what each
  bundle exposes (Shared = directory data; Private = your groups;
  Comms = email staging) and what the privacy implications are. The
  preamble *is* the AC-MCP-A surfacing for the install moment — it
  gives the user a single informed choice point even though the
  install dialogs themselves are separate.
