# Data Provenance

> **Annex to [`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md).** Specializes the **Ingestion** slot of [PNA Spec v0.1](https://github.com/richbodo/personal_network_toolkit/blob/main/PNA_Spec.md#slot-map) for fellows_local_db's `single-source-static-mirror` flavor — column-by-column Knack source mapping (sub-contract IN-1), the backup workflow, and the three recovery paths. Read [`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md) first for the spec-conformance overview; this file is the depth-doc for the build/data pipeline.

How `app/fellows.db` is built, where every field comes from, and how to
recover if anything goes wrong.

## What data we have

The canonical source is the **Knack REST-API extraction of 2026-04-08**,
performed via the API before EHF's Knack SaaS instance was shut down. All
data in the repo derives from that extraction.  None of this data is in the git repo, though, this is all private deliverables.

| File                                                    | Kind    | Row count | Purpose |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------:|---------|
| `final_fellows_set/knack_api_detail_dump.json`          | source  | 515       | **Primary source of truth.** Detail-view records keyed by Knack `record_id`; 86 fields per record (Knack `field_XXX` codes). |
| `final_fellows_set/knack_api_raw_dump.json`             | source  | 515       | Supplementary. Three Knack list views (`public`, `alumni`, `search`). Used for a handful of fields that the detail view omits (notably `field_649` → `fellow_type` for 8 fellows). |
| `final_fellows_set/ehf_fellow_profiles_knack_api.json`  | source  | 515       | Flat Knack export; no contact emails. Not used by the current ETL — kept for historical reference. |
| `final_fellows_set/ehf_fellow_profiles_deduped.json.bak.2026-04-08` | historical | 442 | **Lossy demo subset** from the old HTML-scrape era — fellows without photos dropped, no emails. Not used by any current ETL; kept only as a historical artifact. |
| `final_fellows_set/fellow_profile_images_by_name/`      | source  | 251 files | Profile photos, filenames `<slug>.jpg`. One per fellow who uploaded a photo. The ~264 fellows without photos never uploaded one. |
| `app/fellows.db`                                        | built   | 515       | SQLite DB produced from the above. **Gitignored**; rebuild via the script below. |
| `app/fellows.db.backup.2026-04-08`                      | source-of-last-resort | 515 | A known-good pre-built DB. If the ETL is broken, `scripts/restore_fellows_data.sh` can put it back. |

## How to rebuild `app/fellows.db` from source

```bash
just db-rebuild
```

This snapshots the current state via `scripts/backup_fellows_data.sh` first (so a botched rebuild is always recoverable), then runs the canonical ETL, then prints row / email / image counts for a sanity check.

Under the hood — the raw ETL script, if you want to pass a different input file or see exactly what runs:

```bash
python build/restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py
python build/restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py /path/to/newer_detail_dump.json
```

Defaults to `final_fellows_set/knack_api_detail_dump.json` as input. Pass a different path if you ever run the scrape again.

The script:
1. Reads the detail dump (dict keyed by `record_id`).
2. Reads `knack_api_raw_dump.json` alongside it (automatic) for fields the
   detail dump lacks.
3. Writes `app/fellows.db` with the canonical 18-column schema + an FTS5 index
   + the in-band `provenance` table (below).
4. Prints counts so you can sanity-check (515 / 515 / 251 at time of writing).

To verify the fellows-table content against the reference backup:

```bash
just db-verify
```

Under the hood: `python build/diff_fellows_db.py app/fellows.db app/fellows.db.backup.2026-04-08`. Expected: `✓ column-exact match on all fellows columns`. Use `just db-diff OTHER` to compare against any other DB file. (The comparison is a **logical per-column diff of the `fellows` table** — not a byte comparison of the files — which is what lets the frozen reference backup, which predates both `has_image` and the `provenance` table, keep verifying fresh builds; the diff output notes each side's provenance chain informationally.)

## In-band provenance (the `provenance` table)

Every build stamps a small `provenance` table **inside `fellows.db` itself**, so
the answer to "where did this data ultimately come from?" travels with the data
— into the raw `/fellows.db` download, the PWA's OPFS copy, and any downstream
application that imports the file (e.g. a Personal Relationship Manager
ingesting this directory):

| hop | system | artifact | acquired_at | method |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | EHF Fellows Directory (Knack) | `knack_api_detail_dump.json` (+ its sha256) | 2026-04-08 | Knack REST API extraction |
| 1 | fellows_local_db | `fellows.db` | — | `build/restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py` |

Design rules:

- **Hop 0 is the ultimate source.** An application that imports this DB should
  *preserve* the existing hops and *append its own* — that is how "this contact
  came from the EHF fellows directory, archived from Knack on 2026-04-08"
  survives a second import.
- **Entries are attested claims, not proofs.** Each hop is a self-declaration
  by the application that wrote it; `artifact_sha256` gives per-hop artifact
  integrity (hop 0's is the sha256 of the exact scrapefile bytes parsed).
  Hop 1's `artifact_sha256` is NULL by necessity — a DB cannot contain its own
  hash; `/build-meta.json`'s `fellows_db_sha` carries it transport-side and
  importers compute it at ingest.
- **No per-build volatile values.** Hop rows carry the *source's* dates, never
  wall-clock build time or git SHA — so a rebuild from the same scrapefile is
  deterministic and `fellows_db_sha` (the opt-in update-availability signal)
  doesn't churn per code commit. A re-scrape of a different vintage sets
  `--source-acquired-at`.

The full mapping lives in `build/restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py` as two
module-level lists (`KNACK_FIELD_MAP_COLS` and `KNACK_FIELD_MAP_EXTRA`). If
you change the mapping, update this table too.

## Backup workflow

```bash
just data-backup        # snapshot DB + source JSONs + images into backup/*.zip
just data-restore       # restore from --latest (interactive y/N after manifest)
just data-restore-dry   # print manifest + file list, don't touch anything
```

Under the hood: `scripts/backup_fellows_data.sh` snapshots the current state — DB + all source JSONs + image dir + manifest — into `backup/fellows_data_<ts>_<sha>.zip`. `just db-rebuild` calls it automatically.

Run a backup:
- Before any rebuild (`just db-rebuild` does it for you; do it yourself before raw `restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py`).
- Before any manual SQL on `app/fellows.db`.
- Before any new scrape.

Restore lower-level (same script `just data-restore` wraps):

```bash
./scripts/restore_fellows_data.sh <zip>
./scripts/restore_fellows_data.sh --latest
```

See [`backup/README.md`](../backup/README.md) for details.

## Rollback / recovery

Three recovery paths, in order of safety:

1. **From a recent local snapshot**. Fastest:
   ```bash
   just data-restore
   # under the hood: ./scripts/restore_fellows_data.sh --latest
   ```
2. **From the reference backup DB**. If snapshots are gone or corrupted,
   the Apr 8 backup DB is the fixed point in time:
   ```bash
   cp app/fellows.db.backup.2026-04-08 app/fellows.db
   ```
   Note: this DB predates the `has_image` column (added in PR #19). The
   ETL adds it on rebuild; if you restore the backup directly, re-run
   `just db-rebuild` (or `python build/restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py`)
   afterwards to get the modern schema + image-index backfill.
3. **From raw Knack dumps**. The full rebuild:
   ```bash
   just db-rebuild
   # under the hood: python build/restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py
   ```
   Produces the same fellows-table content as the Apr 8 backup (verify with
   `just db-verify`).

## Historical note: the `.bak` JSON

The `.bak.2026-04-08` JSON file in `final_fellows_set/` is a lossy subset
from the old HTML-scrape era — fellows without profile photos dropped and
no contact emails. It was once accidentally used as a rebuild source,
demoting `fellows.db` from 515 / 515 (fellows / emails) to 442 / 268 —
the "richbodo@gmail.com not on allowlist" bug on 2026-04-20.

The two scripts that produced and consumed that dataset
(`build/filter_demo_data.py` and `build/import_json_to_sqlite.py`) have
since been removed; the canonical ETL is
`build/restore_from_knack_scrapefile.py`, reading the Knack API dump. If
you ever need to look at the old pipeline, pull the scripts from git
history. The regression test
`test_email_coverage_ratio_catches_demo_filter_regression` in
`tests/test_database.py` still guards against any future ETL regression
that would re-introduce the same row/email drop.
