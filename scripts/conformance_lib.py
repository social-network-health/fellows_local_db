"""Shared conformance-checking logic — the single source of truth for both the
pytest gate (`tests/test_attestation_has_evidence.py`,
`tests/test_xfail_discipline.py`) and the report generator
(`scripts/conformance_report.py`).

Keeping the primitives in one module is the whole point of this effort: the gate
and the report must never disagree about what an attestation row cites or
whether a cited test is a live, non-deferred assertion. If they parsed the
attestation or detected markers differently, the report could read "all green"
while the gate fails — the exact drift class we're trying to kill.

Importable both ways:
  - from tests (repo root is on sys.path via tests/conftest.py) as
    `from scripts.conformance_lib import ...`
  - as a sibling of `scripts/conformance_report.py` when that runs as a script.

Pure stdlib, 3.8-safe (no `ast.unparse`).

# --- Git provenance (self-stable report commit) -----------------------------

# Repo-relative path(s) the committed conformance reports are *derived from*.
# The recorded commit is the one that last touched these inputs — NOT raw HEAD
# — which makes the reports self-stable: committing a regenerated report does
# not dirty the tree on the next regen, because an unrelated commit (and the
# report-emitter tooling itself) never bumps the recorded commit; only an
# attestation change moves it.
#
# Why this matters (the landmine this closes): with raw HEAD, the archived
# evaluate-report.json recorded `candidate.commit` = the *parent* of the commit
# that generated it (HEAD at generation time), so it self-referenced a stale
# commit, and any fresh checkout / >=10-commit staleness refresh regenerated a
# DIFFERENT file (candidate.commit bumped to the new HEAD) — dirtying the tree
# for any future clean-tree CI. Gating on the attestation source instead means
# the keystone artifact names the commit it actually describes and stays
# byte-identical on regen. Inputs are docs/Architecture.md ONLY (the attestation
# both reports derive from) — deliberately NOT the emitter scripts, since a
# commit that edits the emitter must not move the recorded commit of the
# candidate it evaluates. See plans/conformance_report_and_gate.md.
