"""Deterministic emitter for docs/conformance/evaluate-report.json — the
toolkit-schema artifact the Personal Network Toolkit (PNT) consumes as the
keystone's `[verify].entrypoint` output.

This is the DETERMINISTIC layer, NOT an LLM audit. It derives the whole report
from `docs/Architecture.md`'s attestation table (via `scripts/conformance_lib.py`)
plus the current git HEAD. Same commit + same attestation → byte-identical output
(no wall-clock timestamp is stamped), so the artifact is reproducible and
CI-able. Stdlib only.

Render contract (the success criterion):
    python3 ~/src/personal_network_toolkit/tools/report-fixtures-lint.py \
        docs/conformance/evaluate-report.json
must report "satisfies the render contract". `render_contract_violations()`
below mirrors that lint so the fellows suite can validate hermetically (without
the toolkit checked out); `just evaluate-report` runs the real toolkit lint when
it is present.

## Why AC-keyed (and where EX/CST go)

The toolkit schema (`tools/evaluate-report.schema.json`) is **AC-keyed**:
`findings[].ac_id` must match `^AC-[A-Z0-9-]+$`, and the schema's own `$comment`
states that EX-*/CST-* are "the only place EX-*/CST-* live — as references
inside the AC findings they bear on." So this emitter:

  * emits **one finding per AC-* attestation row** — the Universal-ACs and
    Flavor-derived-ACs tables, plus the not-applicable table;
  * emits each **RZ-*** row (the Toolkit-Version 0.2 Layer-2 realizations)
    under its **retired legacy AC id** via `RETIRED_RZ_TO_AC` — the schema and
    lint at PNT origin/main only accept `^AC-…$`, and PNT's own reference
    report for prm carries RZ-5 as `AC-PRM-C` the same way (see PNT
    spec/axes.md § Retired IDs). The finding's evidence names the RZ id so the
    v0.2 identity is not lost;
  * **folds each EX-*/CST-* row into the `evidence` of the AC finding(s) it
    bears on**, via `EXTENSION_AC_HOME`. If `docs/Architecture.md` grows an
    EX/CST row this map doesn't cover, an RZ row `RETIRED_RZ_TO_AC` doesn't
    cover, or a row in a *new* conformance-id family entirely,
    `build_evaluate_report()` RAISES rather than silently dropping a declared
    commitment — the same fails-loudly discipline the rest of the conformance
    gate enforces;
  * leaves the fellows-local `UM-*` user-mediation rows and the
    mediated-boundary registry out of scope here (they sit *beneath* the AC
    families and are surfaced in the fellows-format `docs/conformance/report.json`
    instead — they are not part of the toolkit's AC-keyed evaluate model).

Status mapping: a row's `conformant` → `conformant`; `not-applicable` →
`not-applicable` (with the row's Reason as `rationale`); `partial-conformance`
→ `conformant` + `needs_human_review: true` (the toolkit schema has no
`partial` status, so the residual is recorded honestly as a human-review flag,
with the original Status text preserved in the evidence prose).

Usage:
  python scripts/evaluate_report.py            # build + validate + write the file
  python scripts/evaluate_report.py --check     # build + validate only (no write); exit 1 on violation
