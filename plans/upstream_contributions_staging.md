## The matched set

The toolkit gains four **general mechanisms**, each discovered by building fellows and each riding
upstream with fellows as its demonstrating design. They are duals/siblings and share machinery
(`lint-spec-ids.py` header tracing, the `PNA-DEFINITION` sentinel, the validation-not-certification
framing, the three-layer lint/evaluate/human split):

| # | Mechanism | What it names | Origin | PNT status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Exceptions** (`EX-*`) | a deviation the **user raises** and the app handles (exits PNA mode) | cloud-LLM finding (2026-05-30) | ✅ **MERGED** — PNA Toolkit main (evolved to EX-H1..H8) |
| 2 | **Constraints** (`CST-*`) | a ceiling the **platform imposes** and the app handles (stays in PNA mode) | PWA-private-store finding (2026-06-01) | **MERGED** — PNT PR #18 |
| 3 | **User-mediation** (working name) | the **human is the actuator**; the proposer stages, the human disposes | actuation-surface finding (2026-06-07) | spec **not filed** — **MVD-ready**; demonstrate-now (PRM = built 2nd demonstrator); feature deferred. See the **arc spine**. |

| 4 | **Provenance chain** (working id SH-7) | ultimate-source provenance travels **in-band with the data** across PNA-to-PNA imports (hop 0 = ultimate source; importers append, never rewrite) | fellows→prm import provenance finding (2026-07-04) | spec **not filed** — **exporter demonstrator landing** (fellows PRs #291/#292/#293); importer = prm handoff. See [`pna_toolkit_provenance_chain_contribution.md`](pna_toolkit_provenance_chain_contribution.md). |

Plus one **finding/principle** (not a new mechanism) that updates an existing constraint's frontier:

| Finding | Principle | Feeds | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EAR decision** (#258) | encrypt the artifact that **crosses a trust boundary**, not the store behind your own OS | `CST-PWA-NO-SYNC` / `CST-PWA-PRIVATE-SNAPSHOT` frontier (encrypt-then-email candidate) | recorded in fellows; upstream = frontier-note follow-up, gated on #257 |

## 1. Exceptions — ✅ ALREADY MERGED UPSTREAM (nothing to file)

> **Correction (2026-06-08, verified against PNA Toolkit `origin/main`).** An earlier draft of this
> map said "ready to file." That was **wrong** — it trusted the fellows-side plan's stale status
> instead of checking PNT main, where Exceptions was already merged (likely by the PNT agent).
> **Do not file it — that would duplicate merged work.**

- **Plan:** [`pna_toolkit_exceptions_contribution.md`](pna_toolkit_exceptions_contribution.md) — now marked HISTORICAL.
- **What is on PNT main:** `spec/exceptions.md` (concept + handler contract + `EX-CLOUD-LLM` registry), the `tools/lint-spec-ids.py` EX/Relaxes/Reversible checks (incl. the EX-H8 strength-class check), and the `reference_designs/fellows_local_db/Architecture.md` Exception-attestation copy. Initial filing `67d4622`, since iterated.
- **Evolved beyond our plan:** the handler contract is now **EX-H1..EX-H8** (our plan stopped at EX-H7) — adds a per-dimension **strength profile** (EX-H8), a **fail-closed EX-H7** RFC, EARL-style per-clause predicate reporting, and a "Personal Network Toolkit → PNA Toolkit" rename. The upstream version is *ahead* of the fellows-side draft, not behind.
- **Fellows demonstrating design:** complete — `EX-CLOUD-LLM` handler shipped in **PR #226**, **#156 closed**, `docs/Architecture.md` rates it **conformant** with live e2e evidence. The PNT reference-design Architecture.md copy already carries the EX-H1..H8 attestation.
- **The only residual was a reference-design `Architecture.md` snapshot sync — now done (PNT PR #54).** On close inspection the apparent ~29-line "drift" was mostly the PNT copy's *intentional curation* (file-level test refs, condensed prose), **not** staleness: #260's new guard tests live in `tests/e2e/test_private_data_enforcement.py`, which the copy already cites at file level. Only two genuine items needed fixing — a **stale AC-5 test ref** (cited a renamed/nonexistent test) and the **absent #258 EAR non-goal** note. See §2.

## 2. Constraints — DONE (merged upstream)

- **Plan:** [`pna_toolkit_constraints_contribution.md`](pna_toolkit_constraints_contribution.md).
- **Status:** **MERGED** — PNT PR #18 *"spec: add Constraints concept (CST-*)"* (merged 2026-06-03). `spec/constraints.md`, the lint CST checks, the `PNA_Spec.md`/`axes.md` pointers, the SKILL build+evaluate steps, and the fellows reference-design record + § Constraint attestation are upstream.
- **Fellows side:** § Constraint attestation in `docs/Architecture.md` is live and conformant; #260 just **strengthened** two rows (`CST-PWA-PRIVATE-SNAPSHOT`, `CST-PWA-STORAGE-EVICTABLE`) to cite the data-layer no-bypass guards. Those strengthenings are *newer than PR #18*. A reference-design snapshot sync was filed (**PNT PR #54**) — but it turned out #260's evidence was already covered at the PNT copy's file-level granularity; the sync's real content was a stale AC-5 test-ref fix + the #258 EAR non-goal note (the rest of the divergence is intentional curation, left as-is).
- **Remaining:** nothing required. The plan's status banner still reads "FILED … pending maintainer merge" — stale; refreshed to MERGED.

## 3. User-mediation — MVD-READY (demonstrate-now decision recorded 2026-06-08)

- **Plan (now the ARC SPINE):** [`pna_toolkit_user_mediation_contribution.md`](pna_toolkit_user_mediation_contribution.md) — reframed 2026-06-08 from a single upstream-contribution plan into the **arc spine**: one invariant, two demonstrators already in hand, one upstream contribution, with the **MVD path as the primary route**. Satellites: the deferred feature ([`ai_write_proposals_groups.md`](ai_write_proposals_groups.md)) and this map.
- **Tracking issue:** **#252** — *"Workspace user-mediation invariant: name it, test it (test-first), then spec it."*
- **The mechanism (working name "user-mediation" / "informed-actuation"):** *the human is the actuator; the workspace is the locus of ground truth.* Every path that mutates the sovereign store or sends data out of it routes through a user-legible review in a surface the user controls; the proposer (AI / network / importer) only **stages**, the human **disposes**. Already load-bearing across AC-19/AC-16/AC-MCP-B/AC-10/AC-PRM-D/AC-PRM-A.
- **Still test-first (deliberate):** the enforceable claim is bounded to *separation + legibility + attribution* — **not comprehension**. The spec text is drafted *after* the demonstrating tests/attestation land, never before (an unenforceable "user MUST comprehend" line would be rejected by `test_attestation_has_evidence.py`).
- **Demonstrate now via the MVD + PRM — NO feature build required (decision 2026-06-08).** fellows' MVD uses already-green evidence: UM-1 no-bypass (`test_no_durable_private_write_when_browse_only`, `test_worker_is_load_bearing_off_folder_via_raw_rpc` — #261/#260), UM-2 separation (`mode=ro` MCP + no write tools), UM-3 legibility for **egress** (`test_groups_export.py`/`test_groups_compose.py`). The half fellows lacks — UM-3 for a proposed **mutation** diff — is supplied by **PRM**, which already ships the propose→review→apply loop on `native-sqlite-via-filesystem` (M2–M5 merged). Two designs, two substrates. The fellows AI-write-proposals feature is therefore **deferred** (a richer 3rd boundary, not a prerequisite).
- **Remaining work (sequenced in the arc plan §3/§7):** (a) frame the green tests under UM-1/2/3; (b) boundary audit — **honestly attest** the private-data **restore** legibility gap, frontier = **#259**, do not block on it; (c) pin the workspace-AI stance before local-AI/`window.ai`; (d) attest in fellows `docs/Architecture.md` § User-mediation; (e) PRM carries a user-mediation boundary list at its M6; (f) THEN draft the PNT spec mechanism mirroring the matched set.
- **Dependencies:** Step C (upstream draft) builds on the merged Exceptions + Constraints (done) and waits only on toolkit-instance bandwidth after the Tier-0 keystone. Step A (fellows MVD prep) is unblocked and parallel-safe **now**.

## 4. Provenance chain (SH-7, working id) — STAGED; exporter demonstrator landing

- **Plan:** [`pna_toolkit_provenance_chain_contribution.md`](pna_toolkit_provenance_chain_contribution.md).
- **The mechanism:** an append-only `provenance` table embedded **in the Shared DB file itself** — hop 0 = ultimate source ("EHF Fellows Directory (Knack), archived 2026-04-08"); an ingesting PNA preserves upstream hops and appends its own. Entries are attested claims, not proofs; no per-build volatile values (deterministic rebuilds); batch-level (per-field stays AC-PRM-B); readers tolerate absence; the chain itself is sensitive metadata (UM-3 on re-export).
- **Why upstream:** AC-17 makes provenance normative *within* one PNA, but it dies at the PNA-to-PNA boundary — prm's `source` is a flat string with no source-of-source, and cross-PNA interchange is `federated-read (deferred)`. Both reference designs need opposite halves of the same mechanism.
- **Fellows side (exporter demonstrator):** PRs #291 (report emitters + AC-17 legibility), #292 (in-band chain: ETL stamp, determinism + diff-tolerance tests, attestation), #293 (About-page Data source line + export footers). Operator step: `just db-rebuild` rotates `fellows_db_sha` once.
- **prm side (importer demonstrator):** NOT started — handoff spec in the plan § 4 (fellows source label + direct-SQLite parser, source-chain storage, import-batch descriptor incl. ingest-time sha, UI vocabulary, attestation).
- **Filing gate:** re-verify PNT `origin/main` first (verified absent at `facea9f`, 2026-07-04); file only after the exporter demonstrator is merged (ideally both), with maintainer go-ahead. New conditional obligation → reference-design route.

## 5. EAR principle (#258) — FRONTIER FOLLOW-UP, GATED

- **Not a new mechanism** — a finding/principle: *encrypt what crosses a trust boundary, not the store behind your own OS.* Recorded in fellows via **PR #258** (`docs/ac_decisions_log.md`, `docs/Architecture.md` non-goal note, `docs/architectural_findings.md`).
- **Upstream shape:** a **frontier-note refinement** to the already-merged `spec/constraints.md` — sharpens the `CST-PWA-NO-SYNC` / `CST-PWA-PRIVATE-SNAPSHOT` "encrypt-then-email-to-self" candidate from "unproven idea" to the stated principle (encrypt the *transit artifact*, keep the live store tool-readable — which is *why* app-EAR-for-the-live-store was rejected, per #256).
- **Gated on #257** (*Explore: cross-device private data over commodity channels*): until the encrypted portable-export feature is decided/built, there is no demonstrating code, so this stays a principle note, not an attested handling. No standalone plan — tracked here + in the constraints plan's frontier rows.

## Recommended filing order (for the PNT agent)

1. **Exceptions** — ✅ **already merged; nothing to file.** (Was listed "file next" in the first draft of this map — corrected.)
2. **Reference-design `Architecture.md` sync** — ✅ **DONE (PNT PR #54).** Fixed a stale AC-5 test ref + added the #258 EAR non-goal. The apparent ~29-line drift was mostly intentional curation (file-level test refs, condensed prose); #260's evidence was already file-level-covered, so no re-granularization. `just ci` green.
3. **User-mediation** — **MVD-primary, demonstrate-now (decided 2026-06-08).** Step A (fellows MVD prep) runs now in parallel with the keystone; PRM carries the mutation-side boundary at its M6 (Step B); the PNT spec draft (Step C) follows the keystone, test-first, citing fellows + PRM. The AI-writes feature is deferred. See the arc spine §7 for the full sequence. (Verified absent from PNT main 2026-06-08.)
4. **Provenance chain (SH-7)** — file only after the fellows exporter PRs (#291/#292/#293) merge and, ideally, the prm importer (plan § 4 handoff) exists; re-verify PNT `origin/main` first. (Verified absent at `facea9f`, 2026-07-04.)
5. **EAR frontier note** — fold into a constraints follow-up once #257 lands an encrypted-export to demonstrate it.

## Cross-cutting reconciliation note

All three mechanisms were planned to share machinery, and **both Exceptions and Constraints have now landed upstream** (Constraints via PR #18; Exceptions iterated to EX-H8) — they already share the `PNA-DEFINITION` sentinel, the validation-not-certification framing, and the lint header-tracing pattern. The only remaining new mechanism, **User-mediation**, must therefore **build on the merged Exceptions + Constraints as-built** (read `spec/exceptions.md` + `spec/constraints.md` + `tools/lint-spec-ids.py` on PNT main before drafting), not re-introduce that machinery.

> **Methodology note (why this map was wrong once).** The first draft (2026-06-08) staged statuses from the fellows-side `plans/*.md` banners, which lag the PNT agent's actual filings. **Always verify contribution status against PNA Toolkit `origin/main` (the spec files + lint), not the fellows-side plan**, before recommending a filing action.
