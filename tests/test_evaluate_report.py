"""The deterministic evaluate-report emitter must itself be correct — its output
is the toolkit keystone's `[verify].entrypoint` artifact, the thing a PNT
maintainer (or CI) treats as ground truth for "does this candidate conform?".

These run hermetically: `render_contract_violations()` mirrors PNT's
`tools/report-fixtures-lint.py` so the fellows suite validates the render
contract without the toolkit checked out. When the toolkit *is* present locally,
`test_real_toolkit_lint_passes_when_available` runs the real lint as a
belt-and-suspenders cross-check.
